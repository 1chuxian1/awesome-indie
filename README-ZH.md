# Awesome Indie [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Language: [English](README.md) | [简体中文](README-ZH.md)

这是一份可以帮助开发者赚钱的资源收集项目。

一般来说开发者自己尝试从代码中赚钱，这其实比较困难。我将尝试策划一系列的资源，以帮助对此有兴趣朋友从中观察并学习到他们是如何赚钱的，这些侧面的例子，将引导你对自己的项目进行创新或商业化。

起步时项目并不需要很大，只要有利可图，我们都可以尝试一下。俗话说的好万一实现了睡后收入，财务独立，我想这应该是每一个开发者都很期待的事情吧。

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

接下来这些项目很有可能激励你触发灵感走到正确的道路上。

Contributions are more than welcome.

- 有些项目是收费的，可能我没有全部都尝试，之所以添加它们是我觉得它们能给你带来一些启发。
- This repo was once [#1 on Github Trending](https://medium.com/@mezood/making-money-from-your-own-code-has-never-been-easier-but-its-still-hard-2242ddaae6a1)! :_)

<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targeted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->

### Posts

- **[I’m Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/)** by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)

  The challenge that started it all for Pieter. It inspired me to do something similar. What matters is to create and ship a lot, learning in the process, until something is worth pushing further.

- **[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)** by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  Patrick has written over 500 posts and I have obviously not read all of them, but of the many I've read, I chose this one...

- **[Running A Software Business On 5 Hours A Week](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/)** by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  Another series on what solo bootstrapping is about, with an offensive twist. 

- **[How to get more customers](https://medium.com/product-people/how-to-get-more-customers-54f64220e430)** by [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin).

  This is a bit of a too specific topic for this general selection of posts, but the hell, you need to read it before it's too late. Ok, I'm starting to sound marketingy :D 

- **[Indie Startups: The Ingredients of Success](https://hackernoon.com/indie-startups-the-ingredients-of-success-74531fe3a019)** by [fpgaminer](https://hackernoon.com/@fpgaminer)

  Numbers with meaning. fpgaminer analyzed all the products featured on IndieHackers, extracted some statistics and got to some conclusions. Also worth reading for the approach.

- **[What you should know as a founder of a software company](https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/)** by [Ivan Mir](https://twitter.com/ivmirx)

  A guide to the complex world of modern software business: everything from UX design to marketing and writing, with a list of resources to start with each topic.
